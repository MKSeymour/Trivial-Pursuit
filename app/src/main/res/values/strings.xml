    <string name="rules">RULES:\nAt the beginning of the game, each team starts at the center of the board.\n
The team that is selected to go first rolls the dice.\n
The team then moves their piece the amount of spaces rolled.\n
If the team lands on Roll Again they will roll again.\n
The color of the space landed on dictates what category of question that team will receive.\n
\n
The Categories are as follows:\n
BLUE: Geography\n
PINK: Entertainment\n
YELLOW: History\n
PURPLE: Arts and Literature\n
GREEN: Science and Nature\n
ORANGE: Sports and Leisure\n
\n
The team who just rolled will now hand off the phone to an opposing team to read the question.\n
The team whose turn it is will have a certain amount of time to answer the question (as specified in the settings before the game).\n
If the team answers the question right within the time limit then they get to roll again, otherwise it is the next teams turn.\n
To earn wedges on the game piece, the team must land on the game board tile with the wedge indicator and answer the corresponding question correctly.\n
There are six wedge indicator tiles each corresponding to one of the category colors.\n
\n
HOW TO WIN: Earn all six different color wedges on your piece. Then return to the center of the game board and answer one final question of a random category correctly.
